## My process
In the first commit i used flexbox for the solution. Then I changed it and used grid and then finally using position property.
### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- position property
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

That grid is very confusing. I will just use bootstrap whenever i needed grid.(XP)

### Continued development

I do feel bad about not knowing how to use grid. I might look into it in the future.

-> which I did, and now I can say I have a good sense oh how and where to use display grid property.
